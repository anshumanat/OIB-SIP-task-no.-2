            <h2>About Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</h2>
            <p>
                Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, was an Indian aerospace scientist and the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Known as the "Missile Man of India" for his significant role in the development of ballistic missile technology, he played a pivotal role in India's nuclear tests in 1998.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kalam was deeply passionate about education and youth development, often interacting with students and promoting scientific thinking and innovation. He passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong, doing what he loved mostâ€”interacting with the youth.
